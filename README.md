# About the project rastertokpsl-re

Kyocera KPSL filter for CUPS licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0. See the file "LICENSE" for more information.

The reason for development is unexpected printing errors with the original driver.
The problem in the non ASCII encoding of the file names for printed files.

# Tasklist:

 - [x] make it possible to build on Linux (at least on Devuan)
 - [x] add some other ppd files
 - [x] create a list of required packages
 - [ ] update main readme (add requirements and manual for buiding the driver)
 - [ ] improve CmakeLists (maybe not)

# Requirements

To build the project you need Cmake and GCC (I haven't tested that code with Clang and other compilers). Also you need CUPS and its (development) libraries. Below there is a list of package names required for buiulding in different systems.

_(**Note**: currently there is only one entry (for Debian and Devuan), and it's not full due to the fact that I do not have a "clean" environment, e.g. I already have compilers, cmake and other stuff)_

#### Devuan|Debian

* `build-essential`
* `cmake`
* `libcupsimage2-dev`
* `libcups2-dev`

# Instructions

If you have pre-built release (bin folder is already there), proceed from step 4.


1. Run `apt-get install build-essential cmake libcups2-dev libcupsimage2-dev` to install build prerequisites.
2. Run `cmake -B_build -H.` to generate nessesary files  _(**Note**: there are cmake variables listed at the end of the section)_;
3. Run `cmake --build _build/` to build all cmake targets, the resulting binaries are located in `bin/` subdirectory.
4. Run `./install.sh` to install PPD files and the newly built filter.
5. Run `apt-get install libcupsimage2` (Debian 12) or `apt-get install libcupsimage2t64` (Debian 13) on end user systems, for filter to work.

### Cmake variables

Here is a table with cmake variables for use at the first step of instructions.

| Variable | Description          | Default(ON\|OFF) |
|-|-|-|
| DEBUG    | Allow debugging via GDB           | OFF |
| VERBOSE  | Print all warnings when compiling | OFF |

## cups

Maverick 10.9.5 have cups version 1.7.2.
El Capitan 10.11.4 have cups version 2.1.0
High Sierra 10.13.6 hav cups version 2.2.5

[Documentation CUPS 1.7](http://www.cups.org/documentation.php?VERSION=1.7&Q=)

[cups web admin:631](http://127.0.0.1:631)

```
cupsctl WebInterface=on
```

```
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cups.cupsd.plist
sudo launchctl list | grep cupsd
sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.cups.cupsd.plist
sudo launchctl list | grep cupsd
```

Debug cups filters:

```
cupsctl --debug-logging
cupsctl --no-debug-logging
```

Print to file. Use printer/foo to convert to the printer format defined  by  the
filters in the PPD file.

```
/usr/sbin/cupsfilter -p Kyocera_FS-1020MFPGDI_RE.ppd -m printer/foo data/d001.pdf -e > t.kpsl
```

## install
```
./install.sh
```

On the El Capitan original driver not installed with error - Not found software for install.

Need copy kpsl/ to the /Library/Printers/Kyocera/. Installation with warning - printer worked!!

## reverse engineering

Used CLion and IdaPro

OSX version have image symbols

Used [JBIG-KIT 2.0](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/jbigkit/) - link in the resources.

### cups filter internal

[Raster API](http://www.cups.org/documentation.php/api-raster.html#cupsRasterReadHeader2)

Filter read raster stream and write pages in the **stdout**.

### Some rewrites

Based on the existing realisation filters in the cups source: rastertohp.c and rastertoepson.c.

### replace asciitounicode

Use ConvertUTF.c for UTF8 -> UTF16 conversion.

### miniunit.h

[miniunit.h](http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html#Introduction)

## pdftoraster.sh rastertokpsl.sh rastertokpsl-re.sh

Direct call filters without cupsfilter. Used for developments and testing.

pdftoraster.sh - make raster file from pdf.

rastertokpsl.sh - convert raster file to the kpsl, using original filter.

rastertokpsl-re.sh - convert raster file to the kpsl? using re filter.
 

## kpslcmp.pl

Perl script - simple check two kpsl files, skip from compare user, timestamp and title field from kpsl header.

## data_kpslcmp.pl

Perl script, which generates kpsl files for all pdf files in the data directory, using
original rastertokpsl and rastertokpsl-re filters and compare it.

rastertokpsl-re must be properly installed.

## ToDo

kpsldump.pl - kpsl dumper.

## CaBrigtness and CaContrast

Change +-100.
